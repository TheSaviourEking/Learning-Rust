# Learning Rust: My Journey

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! This repository serves as a centralized space where I document my progress, experiments, and projects as I dive into learning the Rust programming language. Rust is known for its memory safety, performance, and concurrency capabilities, and I am excited to explore it.

## Motivation
I am learning Rust to enhance my programming skills, explore its unique features like ownership and borrowing, and better understand systems-level programming. This repository will track my progress, starting from basic concepts to advanced projects.

## Learning Resources
Currently, I am learning Rust using **[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)** (commonly referred to as *The Rust Book*). I will also explore additional resources as needed, including blogs, tutorials, videos, and community forums.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by chapters of *The Rust Book*. Each chapter has its own folder with subfolders for `notes`, `examples`, `projects`, and `exercises`. This structure allows for easier tracking and revisiting of specific topics.

### Structure Overview:
```
/
|-- chapter-01-introduction/
|   |-- notes/
|   |-- examples/
|   |-- projects/
|   |-- exercises/
|
|-- chapter-02-programming-concepts/
|   |-- notes/
|   |-- examples/
|   |-- projects/
|   |-- exercises/
|
|-- ...
|
|-- logs.md
|-- resources.md
```

### Subfolder Descriptions:
- **`notes/`**: Contains personal notes and summaries of concepts for the chapter.
- **`examples/`**: Includes code snippets demonstrating specific features or ideas from the chapter.
- **`projects/`**: Features comprehensive projects related to the chapterâ€™s topics.
- **`exercises/`**: Contains solutions to exercises from the Rust book or other sources.

### General Files:
- **`logs.md`**: A markdown file to maintain daily progress logs.
- **`resources.md`**: A curated list of additional learning resources.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-learning-journey.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific chapter folder (`chapter-01-introduction`, `chapter-02-programming-concepts`, etc.) to explore the content.

3. Run the code examples or exercises using `cargo run` or `cargo test` (if applicable).

## Tools and Setup
To follow along or replicate my setup:
- Install Rust: Follow the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- Editor: I use VS Code with the [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) extension for better productivity.
- Tools: Cargo, Clippy, and rustfmt for project management and code quality.
